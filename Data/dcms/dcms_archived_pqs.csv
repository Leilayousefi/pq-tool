Lord Taylor of Warwick,To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they are taking to encourage corporations to sponsor women’s football teams and other initiatives.,HL1156,NA,2015-07-07,"<p>The Women and Sport Advisory Board convened under the 2010-2015 coalition Government identified commercial investment in women’s sport as one of the themes for wider consideration in its final report, published March 2015. This Government wishes to look more widely at how it can make sport financially sustainable, and women’s sport, including women’s football, forms part of this work. The Minister for Sport and Tourism held a round-table session with representatives from National Governing Bodies, media bodies, sponsorship agencies, brands and a consultancy specialising in data intelligence in order to discuss the issues further. The findings will feed into the forthcoming Sport Strategy.</p>",Baroness Neville-Rolfe,2015-07-21,Not found
"Hussain, Imran","To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, what assessment he has made of the effect of broadband speed and coverage on local economies.",6529,Bradford East,2015-07-10,"<p>Superfast broadband is now available to over 80% of UK homes and businesses, up from 45% in 2010. The UK Broadband Impact Study - Impact Report<em> </em>estimated that the availability and take-up of faster broadband speeds through programmes that had been delivered or were in the delivery phase at that time will add about £17 billion to the UK’s annual Gross Value Added (GVA) by 2024. This level of uplift contributes an average of 0.07 percentage points to real annual GVA growth over this period. It also demonstrated that the benefits will be shared across the UK, helping the rebalancing of our economy.</p>","Vaizey, Edward",2015-07-21,Labour

The textiles sector is still important to Bradford today with companies engaged in a wide range of activities – from spinning and weaving to the production of high performance and high value added goods. I am pleased Government has been able, through the Regional Growth Fund (RGF) programme, to support the creation and safeguarding of jobs in textile businesses through the national Textiles Growth Programme. 11 Bradford-based businesses have been assisted to date, with investment in capital projects, skills training and research and development. The Textiles Growth Programme was granted a further tranche of RGF funding earlier this year – bringing total Government investment to £32.3m – giving more Bradford companies the opportunity to secure support for innovation and growth.</p>","Vaizey, Edward",2015-07-29,Labour

"Howarth, George","To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, what assessment his Department has made of the effect on vulnerable consumers of the switching regime in the mobile sector.",10548,Knowsley,2015-09-17,"<p>The Government is committed to working with Ofcom to support quick and easy switching in communications markets. In its current consultation on mobile switching, Ofcom sets out considerations of how current switching processes may lead to consumer harm. Problems that may occur include consumer difficulty with switching processes, unnecessary costs, navigating different processes, breaks in continuity of service, lack of awareness of the implications of and any liabilities arising from switching, and erroneous transfers and ‘slamming’ (where consumers are switched without their consent). Ofcom’s evidence suggests that, although existing mobile switching processes perform relatively well against those measures, they are likely to generate a degree of consumer harm.</p><p>For those who have not switched, the perception of a difficult process can inhibit their engagement with the market and any decision to switch, which is likely to mean they are paying more. BIS research indicates that consumers who may be vulnerable by virtue of personal circumstances - for example, those who are elderly, not working and/or lack ‘self-efficacy’, confidence or trust - tend to be fairly disengaged from markets and the purchase process. Those consumers are much less likely than other groups to gather information, check whether they are on the best deal or switch supplier.</p><p>Ofcom is currently consulting on options to improve mobile switching, with the aim of simplifying and automating the process for all consumers.</p>","Vaizey, Edward",2015-10-12,Labour

Ofcom is currently consulting on process reforms for switching mobile services, including proposals for a GPL model. Under its existing powers, it has already introduced GPL processes for customers switching broadband and fixed-line services. It is apparent from my officials’ ongoing discussions with Ofcom - and from its recent work and current proposals to improve switching processes - that Ofcom has powers to introduce a GPL switching regime for mobile services, should it determine following its consultation that such a reform would be proportionate.</p>","Vaizey, Edward",2015-10-12,Labour

There is not one single government department, which that leads on the promotion of healthier lifestyles through non-competitive outdoor recreation activities. Instead, Government departments jointly recognise the value of outdoor recreation to health, environment and education. Outdoor recreation is referenced in the Government’s new sport and physical activity strategy, which was published on 17th December 2015. Government will submit a formal annual report to Parliament, which sets out progress in implementing this strategy later this year. Individual government department’s involvement in outdoor activities is outlined below:</p><p><strong>Department for Culture, Media and Sport</strong></p><p>The importance of outdoor recreation is reflected in our new sport and physical activity strategy, published in December 2015. Sport England is currently working with the Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) on the ‘Getting Active Outdoors’ insight report - the largest ever of its kind - to get the nation active - particularly children, pensioners and women. In the meantime, Sport England is investing over £68 million in outdoor recreation sports, including £3 million invested in the Britain on Foot campaign, to get more people hillwalking, trail running and mountaineering.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</strong></p><p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs holds policy responsibility for the legal and land-use aspects of access to the countryside (in forests, protected landscapes, on public rights of way, commons, town and village greens, open access spaces and on waterways).</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Department of Health</strong></p><p>The Department of Health acknowledges the health benefits of being in a natural environment are significant and that it is important that children have opportunities to play in clean, secure outdoor environments. The department recognises the importance of outdoor activities and they have included an indicator on use of green space for exercise and health purposes in the Public Health Outcomes Framework. The health promotes outdoor physical activity through a variety of channels, which includes: Change4Life Sports Clubs - a programme providing indoor and outdoor non-competitive physical activity to the least active children; the 10 Minute Shake Up campaign - Change4Life teamed up with Disney to inspire children to get active with over the summers of 2014 and 2015; providing funding of over 1million to Play England for a three year project ‘Street Play’ to promote outdoor play activities; and National Institute of Care and Excellence (NICE) guidance to promoting outdoor physical activity.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Department for Education</strong></p><p>The Department for Education are is determined that all children lead healthy active lives. Physical Education is compulsory at all four key stages in the national curriculum for maintained schools. The programmes of study at key stages 2, 3 and 4 sets out the expectation that pupils should take part in outdoor adventurous activities. At key stage 4 these activities should take place in a range of environments and present intellectual and physical challenges. Independent research on the primary PE and sport premium demonstrates that some schools are using their funding to provide enhanced opportunities for their pupils in this area – including rock-climbing, surfing and sailing. The Department does not specifically promote non-competitive outdoor activities as teachers have the freedom to organise and deliver the curriculum to ensure it is challenging and effectively meets programme of study.</p><p><strong>The Department for Communities and Local Government</strong></p><p>The Department for Communities and Local Government role in outdoor recreation is community focussed. It recognises that Parks, sports grounds and other green spaces, which are shared by lots of people, holds great benefits to the health and wellbeing of local communities. We want local communities to be empowered to play a significant role in maintaining and protecting green spaces of most importance to them. The Department owns the Green Flag Award scheme, a recognised accreditation setting the national standard for parks and green spaces across the UK, which is currently run under licence by Keep Britain Tidy. The scheme awards well-managed green spaces run by the local authority and has a separate category for community managed green spaces. The Department is currently running a Pocket Parks programme to establish up to 100 pocket parks – small areas of inviting public space where people can enjoy relief from city streets. It is expected that an announcement of the successful projects will be made in February. Through the Community Right to Bid, communities are listing the parks and green spaces that are important to them. Hundreds have been listed including allotments and playing fields.</p>",Baroness Neville-Rolfe,2016-02-02,Not found

The Applicant alleged interference with his article 8 rights and that the interference was not foreseeable or proportionate.

The code is already clear that employers should have policies in place explaining how they expect their IT systems to be used, including setting out the extent to which, if any, the IT system can be used for personal use. Even where no such policy is in place, it is reasonable in certain circumstances for employers to monitor an employee’s use of the IT systems to ensure compliance with any policy or to ensure that employees are not abusing the use of the system.

The majority of current provision for treatment of problem gamblers is through the Responsible Gambling Trust’s funding of organisations such as GamCare, who provide a helpline and counselling services, and the Gordon Moody Association, which provides specialist residential treatment.
