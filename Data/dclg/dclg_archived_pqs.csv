It pledged in 2000 that: “We... are committed to ensuring that all social housing is of a decent standard within 10 years” (DETR, <em>Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All: The Housing Green Paper</em>, April 2000, p.11). But 16 per cent of local authority homes were not decent by 2010.</p><p>That last Government also cut the Decent Homes programme by £150 million in July 2009, cannibalising the housing programme to pay for other policies. I also observe the last Prime Minister planned to cut back housing investment, remarking before the general election: “Housing is essentially a private sector activity. Let's be honest about this... I don't see a need for us to continue with such a big renovation programme” (<em>BBC Newsnight</em>, 30 April 2010).</p><p>However, the Coalition Government is investing £2.3 billion from 2011 to 2016 to improve the quality of existing social housing through the Decent Homes programme and large-scale voluntary transfer gap funding The funding is for clearing the backlog, and therefore is less than under the last Administration – as by intention, there should be an increasingly smaller number of homes to pay to refurbish.</p><p>The table below shows spending since 2005.</p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>£ million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2004-05</p></td><td><p>£578</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2005-06</p></td><td><p>£864</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2006-07</p></td><td><p>£814</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2007-08</p></td><td><p>£1,005</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2008-09</p></td><td><p>£1,017</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2009-10</p></td><td><p>£1,079</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2010-11</p></td><td><p>£756</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011-12</p></td><td><p>£494</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012-13</p></td><td><p>£563</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013-14</p></td><td><p>£631</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014-15</p></td><td><p>est. £532</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>NB.

The Government has not considered support for carbon capture and storage or nuclear power in the context of allowable solutions. However, the criteria based approach set out in the consultation for identifying appropriate carbon abatement measures would require that measures will need to bring forward additional, verifiable carbon savings at a cost effective price.

"Umunna, Chuka","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, what progress his Department has made on each of the six actions outlined in his Department's report, Ethnic Minority Businesses and Access to Finance, published in June 2013; what external meetings Ministers have had to discuss (a) those actions and (b) the issues raised in the report in each month since the report; and if he will make a statement.",211994,Streatham,2014-10-27,"<p>The Ethnic Minority Business and Access to Finance review has raised awareness and encouraged engagement between the banking community and ethnic minority businesses. The report was published in July 2013 with a plan for action. <br><br>The actions were addressed primarily at the industry, British Bankers' Association and others including Local Enterprise Partnerships, supported by Government. Progress against the actions is set out below. <br><br>Action 1: Spreading the Word<br><br>The banking community continues to work with accountants, business groups and specialist business networks through the Enterprise Diversity Alliance and other forums such as the National Black Women's Network and the Yorkshire Asian Business Association, to raise awareness of the range of support available. This has included developing finance guides, refreshing the Better Business Finance website to make it more friendly, and running a national campaign aimed at all SMEs to inform them of the support available, including the appeals process if rejected for finance. <br><br>These details have been made available to ethnic minority businesses through key regional events, newsletters, and the various partners and networks that sit on the British Bankers' Association Diversity and Inclusion Business Council launched in 2014. The Authority also sits on the advisory group of the Enterprise Diversity Alliance, with a number of banks who also run specific Enterprise Diversity Alliance business support and finance work-streams.<br><br>Action 2: Making support easier to access<br><br>The British Bankers' Association, with banks, has run a series of mentoring workshops and because of these, and follow up bank support, some ethnic minority businesses have created their own mentoring networks and many of these businesses have taken up mentoring support. Events are held in areas with a high concentration of ethnic minority businesses notably Leicester, London, Wolverhampton and Birmingham, to raise awareness, understanding and build confidence in accessing finance. <br><br>Specialist mentoring is offered to ethnic minority businesses through mentoring organisations such as Business in the Community, Capital Enterprises and SCA Management Consulting Ltd. If a mentee wishes to specify a particular ethnicity for their mentor they can do so at the matching stage. <br><br>Action 3: Promote the alternatives<br><br>The Government is legislating through the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill to require large banks to refer declined small business finance applications to online platforms, who will seek to match businesses seeking finance to alternative lenders. Community Development Finance Institutions will be able to access these platforms alongside a range of other lenders, including challenger banks and peer-to-peer lenders. This proposal will help put small businesses seeking finance in touch with lenders who may be able to help them.<br><br>Action 4: Use Local Enterprise Partnerships to best advantage<br><br>Local Enterprise Partnerships have been established as voluntary partnerships and are encouraged by Government to ensure that their boards are representative of the businesses in their locality, and are not dominated by a single group or organisation.<br><br>Action 5: Expanding our understanding<br><br>The 2013 Ethnic Minority Business report http://www.sme-finance-monitor.co.uk/ was published earlier this year. The 2014 report is due to be published in January 2015. This work, coupled with that of the bank and BIS supported Enterprise Research Centre, is being used by the British Bankers' Association's Diversity and Inclusion Business Council to determine policy actions to take forward.<br><br>Action 6: Supporting the dialogue<br><br>The Ethnic Moinority Business representation at the Business Finance Roundtable is through Professor Monder Ram of Birmingham University who runs the Enterprise Diversity Alliance, co-leads the Enterprise Research Centre diversity work and is a member of DWP's Ethnic Minority Employment Stakeholder Group. Alongside this sits the British Bankers' Association Diversity and Inclusion Business Council launched in 2014 which includes the leading Ethnic Minority Business experts and networks. <br><br>As actions have been progressing since 2013, no further Ministerial meetings have taken place.<br><br></p>","Williams, Stephen",2014-11-11,Labour

There may be some roads where lights could be dimmed in the very early hours, saving taxpayers’ money.

Equally, not every neighbourhood wants street lighting, as some communities, especially in rural areas, value dark skies.</del></p><p><del class=""ministerial"">We believe that councils should listen to the views of their local residents, and then adopt appropriate local policies based on the neighbourhood, the precise location and the usage of the road/street. I previously noted that “Manual for Streets” contains some useful guidance on getting the balance right when providing street lighting, taking into account the different issues around safety, crime prevention, street clutter and light pollution. Ultimately, there is no prescriptive Whitehall guidance, and any assessment will depend on local circumstances and local views.</del></p><p><del class=""ministerial"">Notwithstanding, I would observe that Her Majesty’s Opposition seem to have a short memory about their actions on cutting street lighting when they were in office:</del></p><p><del class=""ministerial""><em>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</em><em>:</em></del></p><p><del class=""ministerial"">The right hon.

Member has recently tried to reheat the false Labour claims about Ministerial spending on biscuits – to which there is not a crumb of truth. Under this Government, we do not routinely incur any expenditure on refreshments for Ministers other than “de minimis” expenditure on tea and coffee for Ministers’ meetings with external visitors, or on the rare occasion when Ministers undertake overnight stays on official business outside London.</p><p>Our departmental savings have also been assisted by terminating ministerial group spending on Government procurement cards, as practiced by the Labour Government at taxpayers' expense at the likes of Sky City Casino, the Cinnamon Club, the Wolseley, Brasserie 44, Boisdales, Inn the Park, Mango Tree, Shepherds, Incognico, Buffalo Bar, Mr Chu's China Palace, Tantric Jazz and Fat Tuesdays.

However, this understates the total expenditure on new affordable housing in this Parliament. Across England, our affordable housing programme in 2011-15 is delivering £19.5 billion of public and private investment in affordable housing; about a quarter of which is being provided in London.</p><p> </p><p>This investment continues to contribute to the provision of new affordable homes for Londoners, of which 51,300 had already been delivered in London between April 2010 and the end of September 2014.</p><p> </p><p>A further £1.07 billion has been allocated from the 2015-18 Affordable Homes Programme, to deliver another 32,000 new affordable homes in London. In addition a further £180 million has been allocated from the Affordable Homes Guarantee Programme to deliver 8,700 homes. The Greater London Authority has so far announced initial grant allocations of £404 million to deliver 18,000 new homes and are now inviting further bids on a continuous market engagement basis. Again, the grant funding understates the total anticipated expenditure on affordable housing. We will deliver a total of 275,000 new affordable homes across England in 2015-20, with £38 billion of public and private investment. London’s allocation for 2018-20 has not been finalised.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Building more rented accommodation</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The London Housing Bank is a new housing fund intended as a springboard to home ownership for aspirational working households on lower incomes. Through London Housing Bank, we are providing the Greater London Authority with £200 million of low-cost loan funding to deliver 3,000 – 4,000 new homes by March 2018.</p><p> </p><p>The Greater London Authority has already announced the first allocations of funding from the London Housing Bank, which will help deliver intermediate rental homes. These schemes include: Peabody Homes in Thamesmead; Isis part of the wider Hale Wharf regeneration site; and Quintain part of the continued regeneration of Wembley Park.</p><p> </p><p>Under our £1 billion Build to Rent fund we have contracted 4 schemes in London worth over £63 million and delivering 671 homes for private rent.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Improving social housing</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We have awarded Decent Homes Backlog Funding of £821 million to 14 London Boroughs. This funding has so far made 42,110 homes decent. Gap funding granted to stock transfer landlords of £24 million has helped ensure that less than 0.9% of their stock failed the Decent Homes Standard at the end of March 2014.</p><p> </p><p>A further £145 million has been awarded to 9 London Boroughs to tackle their remaining Decent Homes Backlog. This will help to ensure that no more than 10% of stock in each local authority is non-decent by April 2016.</p><p> </p><p>We have also taken steps to protect leaseholders from excessive works charges imposed by local authorities.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Reducing empty housing</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We have provided the Greater London Authority with £29 million to bring 1,600 empty homes back into use as affordable housing. Our full package of reforms to tackle empty housing is outlined in the written answer of 17 March 2015, Question 227326.</p><p> </p><p>London Boroughs have been allocated a total of £720 million of New Homes Bonus funding for 2011-2016, recognising over 140,000 additions to stock, and over 15,000 long-term empty properties returned to use. Almost 50,000 of these also received the premium for affordable homes.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Supporting self-build and custom build</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>In July 2012 we launched the Custom Build Homes Loan Fund and we delegated £5 million to the Greater London Authority to administer schemes in London. Bids exceeding this were submitted to the Greater London Authority and £4.8 million was allocated. We have exempted self-builders from Community Infrastructure Levy and Section 106 tariffs.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Promoting home ownership schemes</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Since the start of the Help to Buy scheme in March 2012, over 5,300 families across London have brought a home using the support of a Government loan or guarantee, of which over 4,200 sales were to first-time buyers. This includes 2,430 under the Equity Loan sales scheme (of which 2,304 were to first-time buyers), 2,175 under the Mortgage Guarantee sales (of which 1,955 to first-time buyers) and 721 Newbuy sales (data is not available for the number of first-time buyers).</p><p> </p><p>We have reinvigorated the Right to Buy, with a proportion of the sales receipts being used to build new housing. This increases housing supply, moves people up the housing ladder and gets people off waiting lists.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Supporting locally-led regeneration schemes</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We, with the Mayor, are investing each investing £200 million to create 20 new Housing Zones which will deliver 50,000 homes in London.

The schemes include:</p><p> </p><p>Brentford Locks West – Get Britain Building funding enabled the first phase of this mixed use scheme by Isis Waterside Development to be delivered, bringing forward the first three blocks which deliver a total of 150 homes.</p><p> </p><p>Grahame Park, Brent – Get Britain Building funding unlocked a phase of this major regeneration scheme that had stalled. The first block of homes was completed in March 2014 with the final homes due to complete in March 2015.</p><p> </p><p>Lewisham Gateway - Get Britain Building funding will deliver 193 units and indirectly support the delivery of an additional 701 homes.</p><p> </p><p>We have shortlisted four housing estates in London for a share of a £150 million Government loan fund for Estate Regeneration. These schemes are in Grahame Park, in Barnet; Blackwall Reach and New Union Wharf, in Tower Hamlets and Aylesbury Estate, in Southwark. They would provide more than 8,000 new homes, of which more than 3,000 would be additional homes</p><p> </p><p>The Government announced in 2012 a UK Guarantee which would allow the Mayor of London to borrow £1 billion at a new preferential rate from the Public Works Loan Board to support the Northern Line Extension. We have aslo recently made regulations allowing the retention of 100% of business rates growth in the area from which to fund the borrowing. The extension is critical to the realisation of the £8 billion Battersea Power Station redevelopment, as well as the wider regeneration of the Vauxhall and Nine Elms area.</p><p> </p><p>Surplus Public Sector Land capable of delivering almost 28,000 homes has been sold in London. This was critical towards helping us achieve our wider ambition to dispose of land for 100,000 homes across England by the end of March 2015.</p><p> </p><p>We have supported a number of other regeneration projects in London. These include:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£141 million capital grant to the Greater London Authority for Olympicopolis – this project aims to develop a new education and cultural quarter on the Olympic Park.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£10 million capital funding for the London Enterprise Fund to support the regeneration of Croydon and Tottenham (2011-12).</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Royal Albert Docks Enterprise Zone - we awarded a grant of £12 million from the ‘Building Foundations for Growth’ fund which is designed to accelerate progress on the zones to maximise long-term job creation. This supports the Mayor’s priority for growth in East London and building on past 30 years of regeneration in the wider area. Regeneration of the Royals will support the convergence of East London with the wider city area.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Tackling homelessness and rough sleeping</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>We have supported the Mayor in tackling homelessness in London through:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>£34 million grant to tackle rough sleeping across London;</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Developing a pioneering £5 million Social Impact Bond to improve the outcomes for a large group of persistent rough sleepers in London;</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Providing £3.8 million from the Homelessness Transition Fund for the No Second Night Out scheme to help new rough sleepers off the street quickly in London; and</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul><li>Allocating £2.8 million of Single Homelessness funding in 2011/12 to take forward a package of measures to prevent and tackle single homelessness, including rough sleeping.</li></ul><p> </p><p>In addition we have provided £167 million Homelessness Prevention Grant to local authorities in London to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.</p><p> </p><p>There is more to do, but I hope this illustrates the decision action taken by this Government to build more affordable homes and help people move on and up the housing ladder.</p>","Lewis, Brandon",2015-03-26,Labour

While we are pleased that Brighton and Hove City Council has maintained weekly collections of residual waste for its residents, it is interesting to note it has a recycling rate of only 25.8% as other, perhaps similar, coastal towns with weekly collections of residual waste such as Bournemouth Borough Council and Southend-on-Sea Borough Council are now recycling over or around 50% of their household waste, in part because of funding received through the Weekly Collection Support Scheme. These and many other councils are demonstrating that you do not need to switch to fortnightly collections to achieve high recycling rates. We would urge Brighton and Hove City Council to learn from these other councils and take steps to improve its recycling rate.</p><p> </p><p>We are aware that projects are being implemented in the city and expect them to have an impact in the coming months. In November 2012, Brighton and Hove City Council was awarded £840,000 from the £250 million Weekly Collection Support Scheme to improve recycling in the city centre by: replacing the existing service with communal recycling points, making the service more user-friendly and introducing associated recycling reward schemes. In May 2014 we received an update stating the communal recycling roll- out should be completed by June 2014.

The homelessness legislation in England provides one of the strongest safety nets in the world for families with children and vulnerable people who become homeless through no fault of their own. Until settled accommodation is available households will be placed in suitable temporary accommodation. In considering suitability housing authorities must, by law, consider whether the accommodation is affordable for the applicant, its size, its condition, its accessibility and also its location. We have made it clear that no council should be sending tenants en masse to a different part of the country.</p><p> </p><p>The numbers of households in temporary accommodation is well below the peak under the previous administration, when they hit 101,000 in 2004. Councils have a responsibility to move homeless households into settled accommodation as quickly as possible. That is why we changed the law so that councils can place families in decent and affordable private rented homes more quickly. This will mean homeless households will not have to wait as long for settled accommodation, spending less time in temporary accommodation. Households now spend on average seven months less in temporary accommodation than at the start of 2010.</p><p> </p><p>London Boroughs account for 93% of households provided with temporary accommodation in another district.

They only relate to specific, named, programmes. <br><br>The new Mandatory Directions, which came into force in August 2014, extended the cap to £15,000 in London and covered the Decent Homes Grant announced in the 2013 Spending Review. <br><br>The law provides all leaseholders with a wide range of rights and protections where service charges and the management of their property is concerned. Service charges are only payable to the extent that they are reasonable, although what may be reasonable will depend on each property, the work required, and other services that the landlord is required to provide. Furthermore, leaseholders have the right to challenge the service charges they are being asked to pay by applying to an independent tribunal to determine the payability of the charges on the grounds of reasonableness.</p><p>Leaseholders can seek free initial legal advice about their own particular circumstances from the Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE), a specialist advisory body funded by this Department, at Fleetbank House, 2-6 Salisbury Square, London, EC4 8YX; by telephone on 020 7832 2500; or by e-mail at: info@lease-advice.org .

We are carefully looking into these concerns and considering options.</p><p>In addition, Tower Hamlets, like all London councils receiving Decent Homes funding, has been required to appoint someone to independently verify their claims for decent homes funding.

"Mitchell, Austin","To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, if he will increase the number of council tax bands to increase the proportion of their income wealthiest people pay as council tax.",219221,Great Grimsby,2014-12-17,"<p>We have no intention of introducing higher council tax bands.</p><p> </p><p>Council tax re-banding would require a wholesale council tax revaluation, hitting ordinary home owners with higher taxes, especially those who have undertaken home improvements. Fundamentally, council tax is not a wealth tax; it is a local charge for the use of local services. The current banded system is intentionally designed to avoid the flaws and inequities of both the poll tax and of domestic rates, the former which taxed multiple-adult homes too much, and the latter which taxed both family homes and pensioner households too much. Both were scrapped for good reason.</p><p> </p><p>I would note that the last Labour Government and Welsh Assembly Government jointly undertook a council tax revaluation and re-banding exercise in Wales in 2005. Four times as many homes moved up one or more bands than moved down. Two-thirds of the net rises were among homes (originally) in Bands A to C, meaning that those on more modest incomes were hardest hit.</p><p> </p><p>Labour Ministers originally claimed that revaluation was revenue-neutral, but this was not the case. In the first year of the revaluation, council tax income rose by 10%, of which 4% was due to that year's increase in Band D rates, and 6% due to more properties in higher bands due to the revaluation (Welsh Assembly Government, <em>Submission to the Lyons Inquiry into Local Government, Annex B: Council Tax Revaluation and Rebanding 2005, Chronology and Facts</em>, March 2006). To place that in context, a 6% rise in council tax receipts in England would today represent a sustained tax increase on hard-working people of £1.4 billion a year, every year.</p><p> </p><p>As the then Chairman of the Communities and Local Government Select Committee, Phyllis Starkey (the then Labour Member of Parliament for Milton Keynes South West), observed: “The Welsh Assembly – I believe it was my party, but I am not making an excuse for it - took advantage of the revaluation hugely to increase the total [tax] take” (3 February 2010, <em>Official Report</em>, column 383).</p><p> </p><p>This Government has already taken a number of steps to tackle property tax avoidance by a small minority.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of finding new ways to tax people, this Government have given extra funding to town halls to help freeze council tax. A further council tax freeze is available to councils next year. We have handed local residents new rights to veto big local tax hikes, so local people have the final say on the amount they pay.</p><p> </p><p>Council tax in England more than doubled under the Labour Government; under this Government, bills have fallen by 11% in real terms, giving families financial security and helping hard-working people with the cost of living.</p>","Hopkins, Kris",2015-01-07,Labour

But our reinvigorated Right to Buy can only be exercised by eligible tenants if they know about it. It is also important that social tenants have sufficient information about their rights to make an informed decision, and to ensure that home ownership is the right choice for them in light of their financial circumstances.</p><p>Precise figures on spending in London cannot be disaggregated from the national Right to Buy campaign. We can identify £378,393 of spending in 2012-13 and £68,500 in 2013-14; there was no London-specific spending in 2010-11 or 2011-12. Figures for 2014-15 are not yet available.</p><p>I appreciate that the Labour Party in London has effectively called for the Right to Buy to be abolished, and will oppose social tenants being informed. Such are the enemies of aspiration. The Right to Buy improves social mobility and helps build mixed communities. As well as increasing home ownership and supporting new build construction (from replacement affordable homes), it gives something back to families who have worked hard, paid their rent and played by the rules. It allows buyers to do up their home, change their front door, improve their garden – without getting permission from the council. It gives people a sense of pride and ownership not just in their home, but in their street and neighbourhood.</p><p>Total national spending was £0 in 2010-11, £17,728 in 2011-12, £1.4 million in 2012-13 and £1.0 million in 2013-14.

If developers fear new development taxes or state confiscation of land, they will be less willing to undertake complex land assembly projects; they will let their existing planning permissions lapse; and they will simply be more cautious in applying for planning permission in the first place.

In 2012 this Government strengthened the law and supplemented statutory guidance to require authorities to take into account the impact a change in location would have including possible disruption to things like employment and schooling on individual households.</p><p> </p><p>Councils have a responsibility to move homeless households into settled accommodation as quickly as possible. That is why we made common sense changes to the law so that councils can place families in decent and affordable private rented homes more quickly. This will mean homeless households will not have to wait as long for settled accommodation, spending less time in temporary accommodation. Households now spend on average seven months less in temporary accommodation than at the start of 2010.</p>","Hopkins, Kris",2015-01-14,Labour
