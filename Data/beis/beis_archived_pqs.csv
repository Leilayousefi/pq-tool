The UK is already playing its part in delivering the Paris Agreement through our ambitious domestic climate framework. We have shown our commitment to the UK’s Climate Change Act by setting the Fifth Carbon Budget in law. This budget is set in line with the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change and has been widely welcomed by the business community for the certainty it gives in our move to a low carbon economy. The creation of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy will enable a whole economy approach to delivering our climate change ambitions.</p><p> </p><p>I attended COP22 in Marrakech this year. The UK played a significant role in driving forward negotiations and discussions – particularly on mobilising climate finance. At these negotiations, progress was made on how to implement Paris Agreement, setting a clear deadline of 2018 for its finalisation. The UK also announced participation in a number of initiatives, including: supporting developing countries to implement their Paris commitments, tackling air pollution and investing further in research and development. For the first time at a COP, the UK had a Green is GREAT pavilion, showcasing British public and private sector strengths in responding to the challenges of climate change, including innovative commercial solutions and financial expertise.</p><p> </p><p>The UK is supporting vulnerable countries to take action against climate change. The UK will provide at least £5.8bn from the UK aid budget between 2016 and 2020 as climate finance which will continue to provide strong support to help vulnerable developing countries adapt to climate change and take up sustainable, low carbon, resilient and inclusive development. This includes technical assistance and capacity building to help countries implement their national plans under the Paris Agreement. UK climate finance to date has already directly supported 21 million people to cope with the effects of climate change, and improved access to energy for 6.6 million people. The finance has also helped prevent 4.9 million tonnes of CO2, this is roughly equivalent to emissions from 1 million vehicles driven for one year.</p><p> </p><p>We have also recently seen two significant global climate deals that – although separate from the UNFCCC process – will be important steps towards meeting the Paris goals. The UK played a key role in securing a major deal to combat aviation emissions, the first worldwide scheme to address emissions in any single sector, and also in securing a historic deal to phase down the production and use of hydroflurocarbons (HFCs) by 2047, which will avoid 0.5 degrees of global warming by the end of this century.

They also affect the climate through their impact upon cloud formation and upon the reflectance of the Earth’s surface. These effects make the overall impact of black carbon on the climate less certain.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report in 2013 showed that soot ranks third behind carbon dioxide and methane as a climate warming agent, excluding its influence on clouds. Recent work by the Hadley Centre found that the elimination of soot emissions between 2010 and 2100 could lead to an approximately 0.15 degree centigrade decrease in global mean surface temperature. However, as several measures that reduce black carbon emissions also reduce other emissions of cooling pollutants such as sulphate and brown carbon it may not be technically possible to realise this benefit in full, even if measures could be fully deployed globally.</p><p>The government is taking a number of actions to reduce emissions fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) for air quality and health reasons which will lead to decreases in emissions of black carbon and reduce wasted energy resources. These include measures to reduce vehicle particle emissions, increasing the efficiency of wood burning stoves through product standards and raising awareness of the benefits of using quality fuel and the implementation of the Non Road Mobile Machinery Regulations.</p><p>Other short lived climate pollutants include methane and tropospheric ozone. Reductions of emissions of methane and precursors of ozone are occurring through measures on vehicle and combustion plant emissions and through the natural gas mains replacement programme. In the longer term we have agreed, in the revised Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, stringent emission ceilings which constrain total UK emissions of fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and oxides of nitrogen from 2020 onwards.

Insufficient controls on diesel generator emissions risk distorting electricity markets by encouraging new diesel at the expense of cleaner gas generation. Following the consultation on tightening controls, the 2016/17 capacity market auctions resulted in significantly fewer new diesel projects.

"McDonald, Stewart Malcolm","To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, what estimate he has made of the total volume of UK-generated radioactive waste that will be sent to Australia's proposed national radioactive waste facility; what the origins are of the waste that will be returned to Australia for disposal in that facility; and what the level of radioactivity is of all the waste that will be sent to that facility.",10476,Glasgow South,2017-09-13,"<p>In 1996 the Australia Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) signed a contract with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) for the processing of spent nuclear fuel from the Australian research reactor at the Dounreay reprocessing facility. The contract contained an obligation to return uranium and an option to return waste which is supported by a MoU between the UK and Australian Governments in the form of an intergovernmental letter. The radioactive waste, which arose from the processing, comprises several tens of drums of cemented waste. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the material when it became owners of Dounreay in 2005.</p><p> </p><p>Cemented waste is challenging in terms of transport and volume, and for the ANSTO waste the return would require multiple moves or the provision of new flasks to ensure transport can be secured. The Scottish and UK Governments consulted on a proposed policy of radioactive waste substitution for the radioactive waste arising from historic fuel reprocessing contracts with overseas customers at Dounreay in 2010. Agreement was reached between the Scottish and UK Governments on 16 March 2012. Waste substitution is an internationally accepted practice where a radiological equivalent amount of waste is returned to the customer in a form that is acceptable. A contract was signed in 2014 with the NDA to enable waste substitution.</p><p> </p><p>The substituted radioactive waste will be in the form of four vitrified residue containers holding waste which falls within the activity levels of Intermediate Level Waste. The vitrified residue (sealing of radioactive waste in molten glass poured into engineered stainless steel containers) comes from Sellafield. Waste in this form is immobilised. The cemented drums containing the Australian-origin radioactive waste from the processing of the spent nuclear fuel will be retained and managed at Dounreay pending final disposal, as the Dounreay Intermediate Level Waste stores are designed to accept it.</p><p> </p><p>The vitrified residues are forecast to be returned to Australia by 2022 and are expected to be stored in an authorised storage facility located at Lucas Heights near Sydney, where the Australian research reactor is located. Following storage at Lucas Heights the vitrified residues will be co-located with a new disposal facility for Low Level Waste and will be temporary stored at that facility.</p><p> </p><p>The Australian Government accepts that it has an international obligation to receive the vitrified residues. The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (DIIS) is charged with identifying a site – National Radioactive Waste Management Facility – for its Low Level Waste currently stored in 100 different places around Australia. The NDA has been informed that following a public consultation process across Australia, DIIS is now actively engaged in dialogue with two communities in South Australia – Wallerberdina Station, near Hawker, and at Kimba. A decision on where the facility will be located has not yet been made.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p>","Harrington, Richard",2017-10-12,Scottish National Party
