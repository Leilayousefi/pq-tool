The CPS’s strategy ensures that it is aligned with the government’s Technology Code of Practice including the principle of cloud-first services.</p><p>In 2015 the CPS carried out a major review of its internal capability across all aspects of ICT including technical, service management, commercial and programme management.

The CPS definition of rape covers any case where the following offences were considered pre-charge or were subsequently charged:</p><ul><li>Rape: Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956</li><li>Sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13: Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956</li><li>Rape: Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003</li><li>Rape of a child under 13: Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003</li><li>Sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder impeding choice: Section 30(3) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003</li><li>An attempt to commit any of the above offences under the Criminal Attempts Act 1981</li><li>Incitement or conspiracy to commit any of the above offences.</li></ul><p>No separate record of the shortest or longest time from the initial request from the police to the decision to charge is maintained on the CMS, nor is any record collated showing the average number of days taken when the outcome of the charging decision is not to prosecute or any other outcome.</p><p>Rape and serious sexual offences (RASSO) investigations can be highly complex in nature and typically involve the review of a large quantity of evidence. In the vast majority of cases suspects are on police bail prior to a charging decision being made by the CPS and where the police seek a charging decision in such circumstances the CPS cannot authorise charges until the Full Code Test set out in the Code is met. The timeliness of a charging decision is determined by two key factors: how quickly the police can complete the necessary enquiries; and how quickly the CPS can then review the evidence provided by the police and finalise the charging decision.</p><p>The CPS recognises the distress caused to both complainants and defendants by delays in the charging process and we are committed to improving the timeliness of charging decisions. One of the most significant steps that the CPS has taken in this regard has been to substantially increase the resourcing allocated to the specialist RASSO units around the country which prosecute these cases. Between July 2015 and May 2017 the number of RASSO prosecutors available to make charging decisions rose from 138 to 197. This increased resourcing has contributed to an improvement in the timeliness of charging decisions. The number of RASSO cases awaiting CPS charging advice for between 28 days and 3 months fell by over 46% between March 2016 and March 2017 from 489 to 263 cases. Latest provisional data for July indicates the numbers have fallen still further to less than 130.</p><p>The CPS is committed to achieving further improvements in timeliness and in May 2017 the RASSO Service Standards were launched. These Standards set out best practice for the management of pre-charge RASSO bail cases between CPS areas and their local police partners. The Standards provide a commitment on the part of the CPS to provide a review of a case within 28 days of submission from the police and sets out an escalation procedure for police colleagues to follow when this target is not met. The Standards also require CPS staff to be actively involved in securing updates from investigating officers where there are significant delays in the police investigation of RASSO cases.</p>","Johnson, Diana","Labour","Kingston upon Hull North","Wright, Jeremy",2017-09-04,2017-09-19,55,"2003, act, sexual"

The policy of the Director of Public Prosecutions is that a decision to terminate proceedings or not to prosecute should not, in the absence of special circumstances, be altered once it has been communicated to the defendant or prospective defendant unless it was taken and expressed to be taken because the evidence was insufficient. In such a case it would be appropriate to reconsider the decision if further significant evidence were to become available at a later date especially if the alleged offence is a serious one.</em></p><p><em>Special circumstances which might justify departure from this policy include: </em></p><p><em>(1) rare cases where reconsiderations of the original decision show that it was not justified and the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system requires that a prosecution be brought notwithstanding the earlier decision; and </em></p><p><em>(2) those cases where termination has been effected specifically with a view to the collection and preparation of the necessary evidence which is thought likely to become available in the fairly near future. In such circumstances the CPS will advise the defendant of the possibility that proceedings will be re-instituted. (Official Report, Col’s 200-201).</em></p><p>Following this written answer and further written ministerial statements, the Crown Prosecution Service has produced guidance for prosecutors to follow concerning the exercise of the CPS discretion to institute, reinstitute or continue proceedings after a suspect has been informed by the police or CPS of a decision not to prosecute.
