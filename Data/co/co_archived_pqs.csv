So we have promised not to build new large, permanent databases; share data within Government indiscriminately; or weaken the Data Protection Act.<br> <br> But we have also listened to those telling us that new data sharing rules could, for example, help support vulnerable people and inform better Government policy making. So we are engaging with organisations, including civil society organisations, privacy groups, officials from a number of government departments, academics and representatives from parts of the wider public sector, to explore how further data sharing could potentially be used for the public good. As we have always said it would be extremely difficult to proceed if those involved in our open policy making process felt unable to support changes. However we are pleased that they are finding consensus on many of these complex issues.</p><p> </p><p>We will not introduce legislation or publish a White Paper in this Parliament but we will continue to engage in dialogue.

Together, these will make it easier for all suppliers to bid for and win public procurement contracts.</p><p> </p><p>The new measures will increase the visibility of low-value contract opportunities and make the bidding process quicker and simpler across the wider public sector. Complex forms, such as Pre-Qualification Questionnaires, are now abolished for low value contracts. Everyone in the supply chain must comply with 30-day payment terms, including suppliers and sub-contractors, and public bodies must publish an annual late payment report, making their accountability more transparent.</p><p> </p><p>For a range of services that are commonly delivered by public service mutuals (such as social and cultural services) commissioners will also have the option of using a ‘mutuals reservation’. This grants public bodies the ability to limit competition to mutuals and social enterprises that meet the tests set out in the directive. This means many mutuals will be able to win their initial contract without having to compete with more established players, allowing them to establish and grow as a business during their first 3 years.</p><p> </p>","Maude, Francis",2015-03-05,Labour

As with every learning and development programme, the content and approach to induction is continually reviewed to ensure that it meets current and future needs.</p><p>Civil Service Learning (CSL) provides a core suite of learning for all civil servants, for example on leadership and management. The learning and development providers working with CSL are based around consortia containing universities and their business schools. MIT and Cranfield University are helping to develop the curriculum for the Senior Civil Service, and the Open University is a key partner in delivering learning for all other grades. They have also worked with the London School of Economics on a Policy Masters.</p><p>Whilst CSL provides learning that meets the needs of all civil servants, specialised agencies and departments do provide their own training. Examples include the Diplomatic Academy run by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and HMRC’s Tax Academy. Professions also provide their own training – for example through the Commercial College and the Government Finance Academy. This provision represents a mix of internal delivery and outsourcing. CSL provides support and guidance on good practice to departments and professions.</p>",Lord Bridges of Headley,2016-04-22,Not found

In addition there was a long-standing shortage of digital skills.</p><p>After the General Election, the Cabinet Office launched the new Government Digital Service to support departments in digitising public services and to redesign our online offering to the public.</p><p>Prior to August 2010, £27,000 was spent on hosting the Cabinet Office site (as well as other agency sites). In August of that year, we switched to using cloud-based services. For 2012-3, £2623 was spent maintaining the Cabinet Office website. In February 2013 Cabinet Office joined gov.uk. The creation of gov.uk saved £42 million in 2012-3 and £50m estimated savings for 2013/2014 for <a href=""http://gov.uk/"" target=""_blank"">GOV.UK</a> from closing down Directgov and BusinessLink.</p><p>The Capabilities Plan, which is refreshed annually, reports on digital skills across the Civil Service. The Cabinet Office publishes Quarterly Progress Reports against the Government Digital Strategy which covers digital capability, as does the Government Digital Strategy 2013 Annual Report. All of these are readily available online.</p><p>Prior to 2010 agile methods were not required. The Government Digital by Default Service Standard requires new or redesigned digital services to be developed using agile methods. Compliance is ensured through cross-Government IT spending controls. Prior to the last General Election there was no-cross Government IT spending controls. These helped saved £500 million for taxpayers in 2012-13 alone, contributing to an unprecedented £10 billion of efficiency savings in that year. All of this could have been initiated prior to 2010. There are currently 5 agile coach positions in Cabinet Office.</p><p>Prior to the last General Election there was no central monitoring of spend with SMEs. Various bureaucratic procurement practices mitigated against SMEs and resulted in a playing field which was biased against SMEs. The Digital Services framework went live in November 2013. 83% of the suppliers are SMEs. Of the 9 competitions so far awarded 5 have gone to SMEs – this is 30% by value.</p><p>Under an IT contract signed in 2009, Cabinet Office staff IT costs around £7,000 per user per annum. We want staff to have IT equipment which actually suits their needs to allow everyone to work effectively and drive up productivity. As part of that we will consider giving staff equipment including tablets and mobile devices when there is an appropriate business need.

Registers are held locally rather than centrally. There would be major technical, security and privacy issues around consolidating the registers to allow a live registration check, especially given that a checking tool would require an elector to prove their identity in the course of making an application. The investment costs required to overcome these barriers would significantly outweigh the cost of processing duplicates.</p><p>The Government nevertheless recognises that duplicate registrations represent a burden to administrators and that this may be the case in particular at the time of major elections. We are currently examining evidence collected during the recent general election to understand the scale of this issue and to identify more practicable solutions than a checking tool. For example, there may be the potential for improvements to the online journey to reduce duplicates. It may also be possible to exploit electoral management software systems to improve duplicate processing. The Government is taking forward this work with the Association of Electoral Administrators, the Scottish Assessors Association and the Electoral Commission.</p><p>At the same time, it is clear that online registration has led to a boost in registration levels. Compared to other means of increasing registration, such as the issuing of Household Notification Letters in advance of polls, online registration is highly cost efficient, even accounting for duplicate applications.</p>",The Earl of Courtown,2017-09-06,Not found
